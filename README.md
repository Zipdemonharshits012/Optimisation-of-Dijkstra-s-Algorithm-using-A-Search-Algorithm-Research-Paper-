# Optimisation-of-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-using-A-Search-Algorithm-Research-Paper-
This Documentation Contains the approach to how to optimise the Dijkstra’s Algorithm. Dijkstra’s Algorithm is used in many areas including Google Maps, Various Social networking Sites, Online Delivery and in a lot of fields. Due to Advancement in Technology as there are more &amp; more users there will be more data and the time to evaluate the shortest path or distance using Dijkstra’s Algorithm is more So We need a better approach than the Dijkstra’s Algorithm. Here comes our A* Search Algorithm and the objective is to approximate the shortest path in real-life situations, like- in maps, games where there can be many hindrances. So we will be using Euclidean distance &amp; Heuristics to find the shortest distance to destination point.
